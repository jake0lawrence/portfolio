> **TL;DR** — 2025 is all about *automation*. Smart Stacks land first, AI Tagger follows, and cross-device sync wraps the year. **Early testers, I need you!** Jump to [Call for testers](#call-for-testers).

## Looking back at the 2024 alpha

Last year’s alpha proved two things:

1. **People hate desktop clutter**.  
2. They hate deleting things even more.

The initial “drag-to-clean” flow was fun but manual: you still had to decide *where* files should live.  
Users kept asking:

> “Can the app just figure out my folder structure for me?”

So 2025’s roadmap flips the script: let CleanMyDesktop organize *for* you, then let you override the edge-cases.

## 2025 focus areas

1. **Smart Stacks** – automatic, date-aware folders (Documents → _2025-Q3 Contracts_, _2025-Q3 Receipts_, etc.).  
2. **AI Tagger** – GPT-powered keyword tagging so searching “quarterly invoice pdf” returns the right file instantly.  
3. **Cross-device sync** – optional Dropbox / OneDrive integration so your tidy workspace follows you.

### Smart Stacks 🗂️

| Scenario | What happens |
|----------|--------------|
| Haven’t touched a file in 30 days | It’s moved into a **“Dormant”** sub-folder inside its existing directory. |
| Downloads older than 7 days | Auto-moved to _Downloads/Archive/YYYY-MM_ |
| Screenshots | Routed into _Pictures/Screenshots/YYYY-WW_ so weekly folders don’t explode. |

All moves are **undo-able** (⌘ Z or Ctrl Z) and logged in a JSON audit trail.

### AI Tagger 🤖

Powered by OpenAI’s function-calling GPT-4o model:

* Extracts subjects (e.g. *taxes*, *JavaScript course*, *wedding photos*).  
* Generates searchable tags within 300 ms per file (cached in local SQLite).  
* Recognises 130+ languages and common file types (PDF, DOCX, MP4, RAW).

A natural-language search like **“contracts I signed last spring”** will soon *just work*.

---

### Cross-device sync ☁️

* Opt-in; no file contents touch my servers.  
* Uses your own Dropbox / OneDrive OAuth token.  
* Only **rules + metadata** sync, not the files themselves — so large media libraries stay local.
