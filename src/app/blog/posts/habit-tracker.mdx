**The Struggle of Staying On Track**

For many of us, tracking our habits is no easy feat. From the moment we wake up, there’s a barrage of distractions—emails, notifications, deadlines. For those of us with ADHD, the constant pull of distractions can make it feel like progress is always just out of reach. That was certainly the case for me, which is why I set out to create **Habit Tracker**, a tool designed to simplify the process of tracking your habits, mood, and reflections without adding to the chaos.

## How Habit Tracker Came to Life

I’ve always been fascinated by technology's potential to help with real-world problems. But more than that, I was personally frustrated with the lack of tools that suited my ADHD-driven needs—tools that were simple, effective, and didn’t add unnecessary complexity. So, I decided to build something that would allow me to stay on top of my habits without feeling overwhelmed.

**Habit Tracker** is the result of that frustration, a tool that blends simplicity and functionality. It’s built on **Flask + htmx + Alpine.js**, which means it’s lightweight and fast—perfect for quick habit tracking and journaling without the distractions of heavy, over-complicated features.

## A Day in the Life with Habit Tracker

Let me walk you through a day with **Habit Tracker**, from logging my morning meditation to reflecting on how I felt throughout the day.

### **1. Start Your Day with Clarity**

I wake up, already thinking about my day ahead. One of my first habits is **meditation**, something I’ve committed to doing every morning. **Habit Tracker** makes it easy to log this habit right when I wake up, thanks to its **modal logging** feature, which auto-prefills the previous day's data from local storage. It's effortless—I click to log my meditation, and I’m ready to move on.

The best part? I don’t have to worry about distractions or complex inputs. It’s a **one-click process**—simple, fast, and intuitive.

### **2. Mood Tracking: A Quick Check-In**

As I move through the morning, my mood tends to fluctuate. Sometimes, I’m feeling energized, other times a bit scattered. With **Habit Tracker**, I can quickly record my mood using the 1-5 **mood slider**. Instantly, the app shows a green ✅, and I can see my mood tracking over time in the rolling average that appears on the dashboard.

It’s like a little check-in with myself. This small action gives me immediate insight into how my day is shaping up, helping me adjust my mindset when needed. It’s these quick habits that keep me grounded.

### **3. Journaling: AI-Generated Reflection**

As the day unfolds, I start to feel the weight of my mood and habits. I decide to journal, but not just with any journal. **Habit Tracker** has an **AI-generated journal prompt** powered by OpenAI, which analyzes my current mood and habit streaks. I’ve set it up so that it automatically suggests a reflective writing prompt based on where I’m at emotionally and mentally.

Today’s prompt might be something like, *“Reflect on what meditation has meant for you this week. What shifts have you noticed in your energy and focus?”* It’s like having a personal coach who encourages me to dig deeper into my progress. This AI-powered journal entry isn’t just a quick reflection—it helps me connect the dots between my habits and my feelings, something I rarely take the time to do.

### **4. Analytics: Seeing the Big Picture**

**Habit Tracker** also offers a powerful **analytics dashboard**, which I visit at the end of the week to get a bird's-eye view of my progress. The dashboard presents me with a combination of **bar charts** for each habit and a **line chart** showing my mood over time, powered by Chart.js.

Seeing my streaks and mood shifts in one visual view gives me motivation. It’s not about perfection, but rather about progress. The numbers tell the story of my journey—how my meditation habit has been improving, how my mood fluctuates based on my routines, and how journaling provides me with deeper insights.

## Key Features Behind the Story

Building **Habit Tracker** wasn’t just about coding a tool; it was about solving real problems for myself and others. Here’s a quick overview of the features that made this journey possible:

### **Offline Capability**

Because I wanted to build a tool that works no matter where I am, **Habit Tracker** is a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**. Whether I’m connected to Wi-Fi or not, I can continue tracking my habits and journaling without missing a beat.

### **AI-Powered Journal Prompts**

Sometimes, it’s hard to know what to write in a journal. With **Habit Tracker’s** **AI-generated journal prompts**, the app helps guide my reflections based on my mood and habit data, making journaling feel purposeful and insightful.

### **Data Ownership**

I wanted to own my data. So, **Habit Tracker** stores your data locally in JSON files and offers an easy way to back up to **SQLite/Postgres** in production, so you’re never locked into a specific service.

### **Customizable Habits**

What you track is up to you. **Habit Tracker** comes with default habits (like meditation, reading, and yoga), but you can easily adjust them through **Settings** or by editing the `config.json` file. It’s all about flexibility and personal customization.

## A Tool for the Journey Ahead

Creating **Habit Tracker** wasn’t just about building a tool—it was about creating a system that could help me navigate my day, track my habits, and reflect on my progress without adding to the overwhelm. It’s simple, it’s intuitive, and it’s always there when I need it.

Whether you have ADHD or just want a way to keep your habits in check, **Habit Tracker** is here to help you stay on top of your goals.

It’s not about perfection. It’s about consistency, growth, and small wins—one habit at a time.
