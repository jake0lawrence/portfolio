On the Fourth of July, floodwaters tore through Kerr County, claiming over a hundred lives—many of them children at summer camps nestled along the Guadalupe River. The devastation shocked the nation. But the tragedy wasn’t just the result of nature’s fury. It was the result of a decade of missed decisions by local and state officials who had chance after chance to act—and didn’t.

The truth is: this didn’t have to happen.

## A Pattern of Paralysis

Public records show that as early as 2015, Kerr County and its partner agencies debated the installation of a countywide flood warning system. But those sirens never came. What we got instead was a pattern: support in principle, hesitation in action, and silence when urgency was needed.

Let’s start with May 2017. Kerrville’s City Council met for a special budget workshop. On the table? A grant to help fund outdoor flood-warning sirens. But despite the relatively modest $50,000 local match, the proposal was tabled—councilmembers citing expense and long-term maintenance concerns. No vote. No commitment. Just quiet retreat.

Fast-forward to March of this year—2025. The Upper Guadalupe River Authority (UGRA), after reviving the idea for a countywide warning system, again hesitated. The project was real, proposals were in hand. But the board postponed action, citing the need for contractor interviews. No funding was secured. No system was built.

And just weeks before the fatal flood, a video from an April 22 Kerrville City Council meeting captured the tone perfectly: “We did not do the siren,” one speaker muttered during discussion of emergency-alert planning.

## A Budget Line vs. A Life Line

To be clear: the cost of installing these sirens was not exorbitant. In fact, UGRA’s latest estimate pegged it at around $1 million—roughly what the county spends on courthouse security every two years. This was not a question of affordability. It was a question of priorities.

Comfort, Texas—a nearby town of just 2,000 people—had already implemented a siren-based alert system. When the floods came, those sirens saved lives. Kerr County had the same option and turned it down.

## Who Bears the Blame?

Governor Abbott has asked that we not “point fingers” in the wake of this catastrophe. But what else are we supposed to do? Accountability isn’t cruelty. It’s how we learn. It’s how we change.

To ignore this chain of decisions—of non-decisions—is to dishonor the memory of those lost and to endanger those who remain.

## What Must Be Done

Now, in the wake of mass death, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick says the state will fund sirens “where needed.” But where was that energy when Kerrville requested funding in 2017? Or when UGRA sought it in 2025? Where was the urgency when these decisions might have actually made a difference?

This must never happen again. Every county in Texas—especially those in flood-prone regions—should be required to maintain an audible, reliable, and tested flood-warning system. No more half-measures. No more waiting for tragedy.

The sirens never sounded.
Let that silence haunt us long enough to ensure it never happens again.
