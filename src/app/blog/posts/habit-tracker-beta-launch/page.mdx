## Why launch a beta?

## From sticky-notes to shipping code – the origin story

I wish I could tell you **Habit Tracker** began with a grand product-market-fit workshop, but the truth is it started with a pile of neon Post-its littering my desk.  

Like many folks with ADHD, I cycle through bursts of hyper-focus and stretches of “wait… what was I doing?” I bounced between half-finished habit-apps that either **(a)** locked basic features behind a $99/year paywall, **(b)** required an always-on internet connection (try logging a cold-shower streak on bad hotel Wi-Fi…), or **(c)** bombarded me with streak-breaking guilt emails.

### The pain points I kept hitting

| Friction | Why it matters | My design answer |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| **Offline gaps** | Morning routine often starts before my phone has cell service in the basement gym. | PWA + IndexedDB first. Sync happens _after_ a network heartbeat. |
| **Rigid “one size fits all” habits** | No two people log meditation or study time the same way. | Custom units (minutes, reps, pages, ☕ cups) with per-habit default values. |
| **No context for mood / notes** | A streak isn’t helpful without *why* it broke. | Inline emoji-mood slider and optional 140-char note per entry. |
| **Streak-shaming** | Anxiety ≠ motivation. | Friendly reminders, never shaming language. A missed day simply resets the momentum graph—no skull-and-crossbones. |
| **Desktop support** | I spend 8+ hrs coding—why pull out a phone? | Responsive web UI w/ ⌘+Shift+H shortcut and subtle tray-notification. |

### Rapid prototype → public beta

January 2025: I hacked the very first version in a weekend—no auth, just a local CSV export for my own data.  
March: a small Discord channel formed with friends who also wanted “local-first” logging.  
June: we’re at **420+** beta wait-listers and a barrage of feature requests (dark-mode widgets, weekly email summaries, graph overlays).

So, today’s beta ships the **core trifecta**:

1. **Habit logging** (custom units, back-date support)  
2. **Inline mood tracking** with emoji slider  
3. **Streak visualiser** that forgives lapses but highlights momentum

If any of the pain points above ring true, grab the build, break it, and tell me how. Your feedback guides the Q3 roadmap—particularly **desktop notifications** and **privacy-friendly sync** options.

> _“Track the habit, not the guilt.”_ – the tagline (and a gentle reminder to future me)

## How to give feedback

## How to join the beta & give feedback

> **No Discord (yet)** — for now everything happens in public on GitHub or privately by email.

### 1&nbsp;·&nbsp;Grab the code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jake0lawrence/habit-track-cli.git
cd habit-track-cli
pnpm install && pnpm dev      # web UI
```
The repo README walks you through running the local PWA and where to find IndexedDB storage.

### 2 · Open an issue (or discussion)
Navigate to Issues → New Issue

Pick the template that fits:

🐛 Bug report — something broken

✨ Feature request — “Wouldn’t it be cool if…”

📝 Docs tweak — unclear instructions / typos

Add screenshots, logs, or steps to reproduce.

First-time OSS helper? No worries — even “I pressed X and nothing happened” is valuable.

### 3 · Submit a pull request (optional)
Fork → create a branch → code away.

Keep PRs focused (one fix/feature).

The project runs ESLint + Vitest in CI; make sure pnpm test is green before opening the PR.

### 4 · Email for anything sensitive
