# üëã Hey there ‚Äî Jake here!

If you‚Äôre reading this, you probably landed on **[jakelawrence.io](/)** because you:

1. Enjoy **automation eye-candy**  
2. Love **sci-fi-horror fiction**  
3. Were told I‚Äôm *the* guy who can make your municipal-court migration boring-proof

Whatever the reason‚Äîwelcome! This post walks you through **how the site works, what to explore, and how the code deploys itself while I sleep.**

<Callout variant="info">
Everything you see here is <strong>open-source</strong>.  
Peek at <a href="https://github.com/jake0lawrence/portfolio">the repo ‚Üí</a>

## 3  From Commit to Production in ‚âà 90 s üöÄ

Below is the **DAG** my CI/CD pipeline follows whenever I push to `main`.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph GitHub Actions
        LINT[Lint] --> TEST[Test] --> BUILD[Next build]
        BUILD --> DEPLOY[SSH deploy]
    end

    DEPLOY --> Script[[/opt/deploy/portfolio.sh]]
    Script --> PM2[PM2 reload]
    PM2 --> NGINX[(NGINX 443)]
    NGINX --> Browser[üßë‚Äçüíª You]
```

* **All green?** A GitHub Action logs into my [DigitalOcean droplet](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/) over SSH.
* The droplet script pulls latest, runs `pnpm build`, and reloads **PM2**.
* **NGINX** proxies HTTPS traffic to port 3000. Zero-downtime, no drama.

Want the gritty details? See the **[`infra-playbook.md`](/infra-playbook.md)**.

## 4  MDX Everywhere ‚ú®

All posts, chapters, and case studies are plain **MDX**. Example front-matter:

```mdx
---
title: "Quantum Pizza Delivery"
publishedAt: 2025-07-04
description: "What happens when your dinner arrives before you order it?"
---
```

Inside the markdown you can drop React components:

```mdx

Time dilation fees not included.
